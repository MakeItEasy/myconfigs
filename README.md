myconfigs
=========

Here is my configs shared. For example, tmux, totalcmd.


tmux
=========
* copy the .tmux.confg to the user home directory

tmux_backup_shell
=========
The shell can save the tmux env to file, and you can reload the env even if you shutdown.
* copy the shell script to the user bin. (for example, /usr/local/bin)
